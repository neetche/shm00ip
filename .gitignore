⍝ Quick explanation:
⍝ STALINSORT is a lambda expression, so it should work on both
⍝ GNU APL and Dyalog APL.
⍝ 1. The parameter vector ⍵ is attributed to A.
⍝ 2. A sequence of indexes 2..(size of A) -- base-1 indexing --
⍝    is generated.
⍝ 3. For each generated index, another lambda checks whether
⍝    there is any number greater than A[index] before it. This
⍝    creates a vector where a 0 is attributed to every number
⍝    that should remain on the answer; a 0 is prepended to this
⍝    vector so that the first number always remains.
⍝ 4. The vector is NOT'd, so 0's become 1's and vice-versa.
⍝ 5. The NOT'd vector works as a selector among A: every number
⍝    with a corresponding 1 in its place makes the answer, while
⍝    the numbers with 0's in their positions are eliminated.
